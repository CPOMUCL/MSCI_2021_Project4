# MSCI_2021_Project4
Develop a (C)NN to automatise the detection sea ice, leads and melt pond classification  

Goal: Utilise OLCI optical imagery from Sentinel-3 to build a (C)NN against altimetry CryoSat-2 data to build an surface classification algorithm

Data: Sentinel 3 OLCI imagery (https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-olci) and surface type classification from CryoSat-2 altimeter

Tools: prototype jupyter notebook (shared on this Github link) in combination with off the shelf python ML algorithms
